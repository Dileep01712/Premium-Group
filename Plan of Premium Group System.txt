💡 Complete Premium Group System (Step-by-Step)

Group Structure:
1. Public Group – Anyone can join. This is where general updates and free content are posted. (Trailer, Teaser, Clip)
2. Private Group – Only paid (premium) users are added manually by you.


Premium Plan Details:
3. The premium price is ₹10 per month for first 500 members. Later it will be ₹50 per month.
4. After payment, users must send a screenshot (SS) of the payment to you.
5. Once you verify the payment, you will manually add them to the private group.
6. Note: No refunds will be given.
7. Every premium user must join both public and private groups.


Referral System:
8. If a premium user brings a new premium user, they will get extra 7 days added to their current plan.
9. The new user must mention the username/First Name of the referrer when sending payment SS.
10. You will verify this and update the referrer’s expiry date manually in your database (Google Sheet or SQLite).


Plan Expiry:
11. Every premium user will have a start date and expiry date.
12. Before 7 days of expiry, the bot will send a reminder to renew to every user's personally.
13. If the user does not renew, the bot will automatically remove them from the private group after the plan ends.


Movie/Series Request Process (Private Group Only):
14. A premium user will send a movie/series name in the private group.
15. The user had to wait for 30sec before sending new msg. Provided by the telegram.
16. The bot will then search the database using your Telegram account.
17. If the file is found, the bot will send the file privately to the user using their user ID.
18. If the file is not found, the bot will reply in the private group: `"File not found"`.


File Sending & Chat Clean-Up:
19. The bot will use your Telegram account (via Telethon) to search and send files in personal chat.
20. After sending, the bot will wait 2 for minutes, then delete the chat from your side only.
21. This keeps your chat list clean, using `DeleteHistoryRequest` with `revoke=False`.


Bot Requirements & Tools:
22. Use Telethon for handling:
    - Managing user info
    - Personal messages
    - Chat deletion
23. Store premium user details (ID, start/expiry date, referredBy) in a Google Sheet or SQLite DB.
